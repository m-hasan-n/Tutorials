# 🎥🧠 Multimodal Video Summarization with LLMs

This project demonstrates a simple but powerful **multimodal AI pipeline** that integrates **vision, audio, and language** using state-of-the-art models like **Whisper**, **BLIP**, and **GPT-4**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Given a short video clip, the system performs the following steps:

1. 🎞️ Extracts keyframes from the video
2. 🎧 Separates and transcribes the audio using **Whisper**
3. 🖼️ Captions video frames using a **vision-language model** (BLIP or BLIP-2)
4. 🤖 Uses **GPT-4** to reason over both image captions and audio transcript to produce a coherent, human-readable **video summary**

## 🧪 Technologies Used

| Component        | Model / Tool            |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Audio Transcription | OpenAI Whisper (`transformers`) |
| Image Captioning | BLIP / BLIP-2 (Hugging Face) |
| Language Understanding | GPT-4 (OpenAI API) |
| Notebook Runtime | Google Colab (Python) |

## 📌 Example Output

**Video Scene**: A surgeon performing a laparoscopic procedure.

**Whisper Transcription**:
> “We’re beginning the procedure. The patient is stable and under anesthesia.”

**BLIP Image Captions**:
- "Surgeon preparing tools in an operating room"
- "Medical staff gathered around the patient"

**Final Summary (GPT-4)**:
> “This video depicts a surgical team performing a laparoscopic procedure. The patient is stable, and the staff are preparing and coordinating under surgical lighting.”
